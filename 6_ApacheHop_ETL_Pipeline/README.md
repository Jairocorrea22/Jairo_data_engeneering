## üßê About <a name = "sobre"></a>

For those who, like me, like to work with ETL, here is a recommendation of an amazing open source tool, Apache Hop.
With Hop you can orchestrate data and metadata in a very user-friendly environment, and you can connect to multiple data sources. 
The Apache Hop has a very fast learning curve.
 
I will be posting some examples of Pipelines created in an ETL flow.
